# Java Star Pathfinding Visualization

## Overview

This Java application allows users to visualize and interact with a star pathfinding algorithm on a grid. The application enables users to create a start node, an end node, and draw walls on the grid to observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path between the start and end nodes.

## Features

- **Create Start and End Nodes:**
  - Press 's' and left-click on the grid to create the start node.
  - Press 'e' and left-click on the grid to create the end node.

- **Draw Walls:**
  - Left-click and drag on the grid to draw walls.
  - Right-click on existing walls to remove them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-star-pathfinding.git
