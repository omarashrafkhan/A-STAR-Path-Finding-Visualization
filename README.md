# Java Star Pathfinding Visualization

## Overview

This Java application allows users to visualize and interact with a star pathfinding algorithm on a grid. The application enables users to create a start node, an end node, draw walls on the grid, and control the speed of the animation using a slider. This allows users to observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path between the start and end nodes with varying animation speeds.

## Features

- **Create Start and End Nodes:**
  - Press 's' and left-click on the grid to create the start node.
  - Press 'e' and left-click on the grid to create the end node.

- **Draw Walls:**
  - Left-click and drag on the grid to draw walls.
  - Right-click on existing walls to remove them.

- **Control Animation Speed:**
  - Use the slider to control the speed of the pathfinding algorithm animation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-star-pathfinding.git

2. Open the file in a code editor e.g. Vs Code/Intellij Idea
3. Run the application from the MainFrame.java class
